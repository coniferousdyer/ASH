# ASH - The A-SHell

<b>ASH (or the A-SHell)</b> is a simple shell written in C, similar to bash. It supports several functionalities, including I/O redirection, piping, job control and many bash commands.

## Commands

* `baywatch`: A modified version of the bash command watch, that works for three specific commands: <br>

1. <b>interrupt:</b> Prints the number of times the CPUs have been interrupted by the keyboard controller (i8042 with IRQ 1)

2. <b>newborn:</b> Prints the PID of the most recently created process.

3. <b>dirty:</b> Prints the size of the part of memory that is dirty.
```bash
baywatch -n <interval> interrupt
baywatch -n <interval> newborn
baywatch -n <interval> dirty
```

Press <kbd>Q</kbd> to terminate the command.

* `bg`: Changes the state of a stopped background job to running.
```bash
bg <job_number>
```

* `cd`: Changes the working directory of the shell.
```bash
cd
cd - # To go to the previous working directory
cd ~
cd ../..
cd dir_1/dir_2/dir_3
```

* `echo`: Prints the text following "echo" on the terminal.
```bash
echo "Hello World"
echo Welcome to ASH
```

* `fg`: Brings the running/stopped background job to the foreground.
```bash
fg <job_number>
```

* `history`: Displays a list of the commands previously used (at most the 20 latest commands).
```bash
history
history <n> # To display last n commands used
```

* `jobs`: Prints a list of all currently running background processes spawned by the shell in alphabetical order of the command name, along with
the job number, process ID and the state.
```bash
jobs
jobs -s
jobs -r
jobs -rs
jobs -s -r
```

* `ls`: Lists the contents of a particular directory.
```bash
ls
ls -a
ls -l
ls -al
ls -la
ls -a -l
ls -l -a
ls ../../dir_1/dir_2
ls ~
ls dir_1/file_name
```

* `pinfo`: Displays information about a particular process.
```bash
pinfo # Displays information about the shell process itself
pinfo <pid>
```

* `pwd`: Prints the absolute path of the current working directory.
```bash
pwd
```

* `repeat`: Executes a given command n times.
```bash
repeat <n> <command>
```

* `replay`: Executes a particular command in fixed time interval for a certain period.
```bash
replay -command <command> -interval <interval> -period <period>
```

* `sig`: Sends the signal corresponding to signal numberâ€‹ to the process with the particular job number.
```
sig <job_number> <signal_number>
```

* <b>System Commands: </b>ASH should run many of the processes that bash can, including `gedit`, `vim`, `clear`, etc.
```bash
gedit
vim
clear
ps
```

* <b>Background Processes: </b>Add `&` at the end of the command to run it as a background process. This however only works for system commands, and not shell built-ins.
```bash
gedit &
```

* <b>Arrow Keys: </b>Acts as a shortcut to easily view previous commands, and execute them, just like in bash.<br>
<kbd>UP</kbd> - View earlier commands<br>
<kbd>DOWN</kbd> - View more recent commands

## Setup

* Run the following to generate the executable from the makefile.
```bash
make
```
* To start the shell, run the following command.
```bash
./shell
```

* To exit the shell, run the following command within the shell.
```bash
exit
```

## Code Division

* `main.c`: Contains the main() function where execution starts.

* `utilities.c`: Contains utility functions that are either used for input processing or performing general tasks. Also contains the implementation of the `repeat` command and the code taking care of piping.

### Header Files

* `commands.h`: Contains the declarations of all the functions present in the `commands` folder.

* `util_variables.h`: Contains macros and important global variables used throughout the program.

* `utilities.h`: Contains the declarations of all the functions present in `utilities.c`.

### Commands

* `arrow.c`: Contains the implementation of the arrow key handling, which shows previous commands.

* `baywatch.c`: Contains the functions required for the implementation of the baywatch command.

* `bg.c`: Contains the implementation of the bg command.

* `cd.c`: Contains the functions required to change the working directory.

* `echo.c`: Contains the implementation of the echo command.

* `execute.c`: Contains the central function that takes care of command execution, as well as the code taking care of I/O redirection.

* `fg.c`: Contains the implementation of the fg command.

* `history.c`: Contains the functions required to display the history of commands used.

* `jobs.c`: Contains the functions necessary to list the background jobs.

* `ls.c`: Contains the functions required to list the contents of a directory.

* `pinfo.c`: Contains the functions required to display information about a particular process.

* `pwd.c`: Contains the implementation for the pwd command.

* `replay.c`: Contains the implementation of the replay command.

* `signal.c`: Contains the implementation of the sig command, as well as the signal handlers used.

* `terminal.c`: Contains the functions required to modify and obtain terminal attributes.

## Assumptions

* 6 months is exactly equal to 15778463 seconds.

* By the process name supposed to be printed when a background process exits abnormally, we mean the name of the command used to run that background process.
